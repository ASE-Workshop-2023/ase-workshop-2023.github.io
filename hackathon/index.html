from Wednesday 11:30 until the end of the
workshop. Feel free to move between tutorials
and hackathon.</p><p>Some participants will be experienced contributors. Others are
beginners for whom the hackathon can serve as an introduction to code
development in ASE. Both groups are encouraged to participate in the
hackathon.
You can work on your favourite feature if you have one, but we will
also define completely new tasks suitable for beginners who
need not know anything in advance.
We particularly value work on tests, code refactoring (cleaning up),
or documentation, rather than new features as such.</p><p>Before and during the hackathon we will have meetings to discuss
and define implementation tasks. This will be done on the ASE issue tracker.
Tasks will be small and possible to accomplish in a limited
amount of time.</p><p>Make sure you have a Gitlab account, clone ASE, and install as
editable using e.g. &ldquo;pip install &ndash;editable <ase directory>&rdquo;.
You will need to install pytest and pytest-mock
(&ldquo;pip install pytest pytest-mock&rdquo;) to run the tests.</p><p>Participants are encouraged to work in pairs (pair programming).
Changes are supposed to be integrated via merge requests which are
then reviewed before being merged. Participants with previous
experience are encouraged to pair with beginners and work as tutors.</p></aside></main><footer><small>Built using <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> with the <a href=https://github.com/splch/hugo-simplecss>simplecss</a> template â™¡</small></footer></body></html>
