title: Accommodation

Subsidised accommodation is provided to most attendees at [Travelodge Warrington](https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/189/Warrington-hotel): if you chose to use subsidised accommodation during registration and have paid then you should be able to check in from Mon 24 and check out on Fri 28. (Unless you have discussed some other arrangement with the organisers.)

Invited speakers are staying in other hotels and should have received relevant information about these.
