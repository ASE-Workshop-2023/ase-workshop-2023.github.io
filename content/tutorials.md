Tutorials will be held from Wednesday 26 to Friday 28 April.

Attendees will need to bring a laptop computer with a modern web
browser. A Linux-based virtual environment will be provided with
pre-installed software including Jupyter Lab.

The tutorials T1-T4 cover core ASE features and have been produced by
the organisers for this workshop. They will be delivered in "Software
Carpentry" style by Lucy Whalley, Pietro Delugas and Adam Jackson. 
The website for the core tutorials is [here](https://ase-workshop-2023.github.io/tutorial/).

Tutorial T5 will be delivered by Ask Larsen and covers calculation
workflows.

Tutorials TC1-TC2 are contributed by workshop attendees Toma Susi and
Steen Lysgard, covering the AbTEM and ACAT packages, respectively.

Tutorial TC3 will be led remotely by Malvika Sharan (OLS, Turing Way)
and facilitated by Adam Jackson and Lucy Whalley; this will include
discussion of how to apply Open Science practices in our work.

An hour is allocated on Friday morning to "Bring Your Own Problem";
this will be a more informal session in which attendees can share
practical issues in their own work and seek expert advice.
